# Miscellaneity
Hi, and welcome to my first website! [Here's the link!](https://valensce.github.io/Miscellaneity/)

Being my very first project requiring code, I do realise that this repository could be improved in various aspects, whether it be efficiency, maintainability, or responsiveness. The objective of the task is to create any kind of website that can demonstrate the basic functionalities of HTML. Consequently, I have decided to name this project "Miscellaneity", ultimately emphasising the randomness of its substituents.

<details><summary>Detailed summary</summary>
The following summaries briefly outline the content of the pages you'll find:

Index.html - This is the home page of my website, and it has boxed and hyperlinked images that take you to the destination described right below them. When you hover your pointer over the box, it changes colour - from light grey to black. This is my own unique design for a stylish homepage, where the links and titles are always in the navigation bar at the top. ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ

News.html - This is where I included a snapshot of one of my English assignments from last year, talking about Australia's constitution. It is the first link on the navigation bar, where it will turn lilac when you hover your mouse over "News". Not only does this page have a series of paragraphs, but also images that are well-positioned into the center and a copyright line at the end, written in the small font. All text I've written visible on my webpages have been styled in customised fonts to make it readable and classier. (≧∀≦)ゞ

Do_aliens_exist.html - This page is one of my first pages I created, because I began with the idea of investigating extra-terrestrial life existence. It has a highly engaging design that will surely capture any reader's attention, from its striking images, fancy fonts, use of columns, and awesome design. (≧∇≦)ﾉ

Whats_the_HST.html - This page is a snapshot of my Space assignment for Science last year on the Hubble Space Telescope. It's a fascinating piece of technology that explores the universe and beyond. It suits well into my space theme and links to the alien page. Some highlights of this page are: The floating images on the left and right, the padding used to beautifully space out the images, and once again, the work itself. Everything on that page is written by me, meaning nothing has been copied and pasted from the internet. This has been proven by Turnitin last year, where it held a 0% similarity report. STUNNING! ( •̀ ω •́ )✧

Calculus.html - This is my first page to include some of my most unique problem-solving techniques applied into differential calculus and integration. It comprises a brief overview of how I started my journey in mathematics, and then a series of examples of my work over the course of five weeks. There is no need to reference anything, because all the solutions provided are handwritten and solved by me in OneNote. Have fun with this page!

About_the_author.html - This is an introduction of me and my pet golden retriever Prado. After that section, there is a gallery of photos. I hope you have as much fun and anticipation on this page as you do on my other pages! ㄟ(≧◇≦)ㄏ
